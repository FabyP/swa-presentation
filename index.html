                    Well.. If you cant spend your valentines day with someone you love, I hope you at least can spend with something you love. For exmaple coding, connecting with new people and learning cool new stuff, hopefully from my presentation as well, even though
                    the topic isnt about love but about a, I would say peaceful battle without a winner between classical UI5-Controls and UI5 web components.

                            and I will give the word back to Fabienne.</li>

                        <li>I dont know if some of you have been there, at least I was there and my key takeaway were the UI5 web components</li>
                        <li>Enterprise class re-usable UI-Elements for a broad range of web frameworks, with a great performance, the same fancy fiori three design from normal UI5 controls and they are completely enterprise ready</li>
                        <li>So the day after UI5con, I asked my friend google and started researching</li>

                        <li>Of course I ended up on the official page of the UI5 webcomponents and I remember that there were three simple examples, just a small to do list, all looking the same, but they were implemented with different frameworks</li>
                        <li>One with View, one with Angular, and one with react</li>
                        <li>And I ran a google light house performance test on all three of them, for those who dont know google lighthose, it's part of the chrome development tools in your audits tab</li>
                        <li>In those audits, a website can achive a score from 1 to 100, with 100 as the best possible score you can get</li>
                        <li>And those were the results: React an view both achieved a score of 98, while angular was slightly worse with a score of 95</li>
                        <li>But it's still awesome</li>
                        <li>Considering that nothing in life is ever that easy and perfect, we decided to take a deeper look and compare "classical" UI5 with the UI5 Web Components in a real world example using React.js</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>For this example:</li>
                            <li>Lets imagine a town called SAP-city or Sapolis (just stole this idea from metropolis, pardon me , if i pronounce too german) and this town needs an application to have an overview about their upcoming public events. So we have
                                some sort of organizer, where staff members can create new events and see existing events. We thought about maybe even make this overview of the events public, so town citizens are able to see whats happening in their hometown,
                                as well</li>
                            <li>Then there is this huge institution called Euopean Union with a ton of laws and requirements concerning accessibility such as EU 2016/2102 and the WCAG Guidelines. I dont wanna bother you with that stuff too much.Lets keep
                                things short and say everyone and their mother, maybe even your cat, must be able to access the application.</li>
                            <li>The use of a completely thought throug design language (in case of colorization, contrasts and so on) would be a great start to build a accessible app and by pure chance, SAP Fiori is such a design language and would be perfect
                                for our eventmanger</li>
                            <li>so, lets build the 1.000.000th organizer cause the world doesnt have enough already. Not the hero we needed, but the hero we get</li>
                            <li>We developed two eventmangagers, one with react and the UI5web components and one with SAPUI5, both look similiar and have the same functionality</li>

                        <li>So we have a similar looking frontend, now it's time to analyse both versions mainly from the point of view of a web developer, thats why we did take a look at the documentation, the amount of controls or compopnents you can use,

                            <li>In SAPUI5 we have a huge online documentation with an API, we have a ton of examples, we have the platform openSAP for free, there are many blogs and books about SAPUI5 and so on</li>
                            <li>On the contrary, we have react, with an overall okay documentation and then there are the UI5 web components with little documentation and nearly nothing about the combination of react an the web components. The only plus was
                                a way more active stackoverflow community from react, but in the end, developing the sapolis eventmanager in react took way more time than with SAPUI5</li>

                            <li>I've listened to the UI5 News Podcast and it was mentioned there, that SAPUI5 has about 600 controls, well not only controls, but also predefined layouts etc. and if you look in the online documentation, there at least so many
                                that you dont wanna count them anymore</li>
                            <li>And the web components only adapted 26 controls. Thats it, thats everything you can work with</li>

                            <li>This means:</li>
                            <li>Lighthouse doesn't look at when are all my files loaded, but when can the user see first content, when is he able to interact with my application and thats exactly what those metrics with their weight do.</li>
                            <li>By the weight you can see which ones are the most important ones, so first-conentful paint is when my user sees the content, interactive means when can he interact with the application and the speed index is the average loading
                                time till UI Elements are displayed. So those three are the most important ones.</li>
                            <li>Again, we have a score from 1 to 100, with 100 as the best possible score</li>

                            <li>Those are the results</li>
                            <li>SAPUI5 got a score of 30, while React with the UI5 Web Components got a score of 95. The results depend on your testing environment, if you wanna recreate this, your results may differ</li>

                            <li>In SAPUI5, it takes 5 seconds till we're able to see first content and we have to wait further 4 seconds to be able to interact with the application. Makes in total 9 seconds till the user can start effectively working with
                                our Fiori App. And in our other application with React, whick looks completely the same and provides the same functionality, youve seen it, the site is fully loaded after 2,6 seconds.</li>
                            <li>The reason for this, is, that in SAPUI5, we have a ton of unused CSS that is loaded, even for controls we havent even used. And there is the SAP ui core library, which somehow blocks rendering.</li>
                            <li>On the contrary, we have a react, a framework that comes with much less overhead and as a developer, i was able to specify, which resources I want to have loaded in my application</li>
                            <li>This makes react extremely lightweight</li>
                            <li>Moreover, react uses a virtual dom, so if the state of one of my UI components changes, those actions are executed on a virtual dom. React then compares my changed virtual dom with my real dom and only changes those elements,
                                which differ from the real dom</li>
                            <li>Maybe to add something here: We don't want to put SAPUI5 Controls in a bad light. We have seen it today. The UI5 Team is working hard on the performance, we have seen the performance improvements to make the core smaller and
                                just use the controls and libraries which I really need. The performance is getting better.</li>

                            <li>I detected some more differences, for example the profile picture and logo in my shellbar. In react, my testsoftware wasnt happy with them, complaining about missing alternative texts. And in SAPUI5, this simply wasnt the case.
                                I can just assume, that those pictures in SAPUI5 are rendered with the aria attribute presentation or something like that.</li>
                            <li>So: If you want to build your application with react, be careful, you have a lot more work to do concerning accessibility. And sometimes there isnt even a direct way of changing somehing from predefined components such as those

                        <li>In SAPUI5, we have a strict distribution into layout, functionality and model (MVC), while in react, we have all three of them combined in one component. This makes them reusable, but also worse to maintain the bigger my application
                            gets, especially cause react lacks clearly defined best practices</li>
                        <li>And the other striking difference is the need off CSS in react, actually you need a ton of it, cause there arent much predefined components or layouts you can use like in SAPUI5</li>
